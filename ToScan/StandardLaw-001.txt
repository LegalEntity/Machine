ULC Does Uniform Law and that is more needed now than ever. Not only for content but particularly for process. 

# Standard Law Roadmap 
## public connection infrastructure
high level architecture and roadmap 
 (bus, platform, network, infrastructure...)

* public content interface 
 - for publishing the law and primary legal content
- Standards are needed now for the format, syntax & structure of the content 
- versioning and authentication of official source 

* public communications interface for:
  - comment (questions, opinions) 
  - contribution (errors, proposals) 
  - compliance (data feeds, transactions)

- Natural person narrative language oriented Standards needed for naming, citing, point-based, object-based, range-based (array / collection based?) referencing and direct support for discoverable annotating  about the content

- Device/software oriented Machine readable communications standards for 
 -- pub/sub and network "listeners" (for event based triggers) supporting distributed official 
-- integration of transclusion of authoritative source (GAAP Codification)

* Public computation interface 
 - basic exploration (PubDataExplorer/SIMILE)
 - simulations of current and Bills or NPRM regs based on algorithmic law success metrics and test harness 
 - advanced/not supported complex modeling and data science
** one day for new field of legal informatics & jurimetric analytics
