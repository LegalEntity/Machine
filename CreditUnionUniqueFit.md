# Unique Value, Fit and Readiness of Federal Credit Unions

**The law.MIT.edu Credit Union prototoype may be a good fit for automation and blockchain prototyping and innovation.  Modern services that are in line with existing intended role of credit unions and current purposes of law and reg include: 

* Providing identity as a service for members and using blockchain to supercharge identity (basic identity services are web-facing, token based and interoperable via common interfaces (eg REST API) and recognized open standards like OpenID Connect).  
* Providing personal data stores/vaults as a service for members so they can collect, store, use (keep handy when needed, integrate with other services, do analytics, etc) and even make available to third parties “data aggregators” as a more reliable option that also can yield much more accurate, complete and up to date information and yet ensure reliable contractual basis for access and use of the information (based on legal instruments like contracts with credit union fiduciaries and with proper recorded consent of individuals).  If provided in easy to access/use methods and at larger scales and population segments, this service could provide Credit Union members a significant revenue stream to keep loan rates and other costs to a minimum and can provide third party aggregators a better option to current questionable methods used to compile and sell person data about individuals.  
* Access to a wider variety of innovative financial products and relationships, available through approved apps and services connected through modern APIs (ie OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect integrated services and apps via any app store or third party provider) 
* Contain risks of identity theft, other frauds and reduce the cost/hassle of password management by enabling Members to use their Credit Union home banking account to login with a click to other sites and apps through OAuth 2 tokens so they never share their Credit Union username/password and don’t need to manage any of the external usernames/passwords of the sites they can login to with their service-based identity.  Technically, this is exactly like logging in with Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc except as a federally chartered Credit Union, the identity provider is a trustworthy entity (ie it is regulated, insured, audited and supervised entity capable of holding and moving money for people and is capable of protecting and managing personal data and individual identity as another high value asset of Members. 
* Provide better quality identity for individuals that alternative identity service providers such as social media and web service companies because the identity accounts are properly enrolled according to KYC and other requirements and are actively overseen and maintained as part of Credit Unions financial risk, regulatory compliance and other core responsibilities.  
* Provide user-centered identity and personal data services that are primarily focused on the needs and best interests of the individuals to whom the identities and personal data belong.  The highest expression of a user-centered identity and personal data offering is called “Portability” and it means that people are able to easily move from one identity or data provider to another without experiencing undue obstacles or disruptions in service due to lack of support for processes for moving service provider or sometimes based on deliberate obstacles even to export of all relevant data based on profit incentives to lock-in customers to services.  

The identity and personal data portability function is a good example of why federally chartered Credit Unions may be a very good fit for pilots of this type.  The unusual historic context and role of Credit Unions is uniquely well aligned for the role of providing individual identity and personal data services without the incentives and drivers that tend to result in other types of organizations to lock-in customers and exploit their personal assets to serve the interests of other parties. Credit Unions are literally fiduciaries to and owned by the Members and exist for the purpose of serving the needs and interests of Members as an institutional provider of savings, loans and other related products and services.  As fiduciary provider of collective personal asset management for individuals by an institution that is properly capitalized, operated by trained and supervised staff, subject to stringent examination, audit and oversight and already set up to manage personal assets through web-based channels such as home banking sites and mobile apps, there may be no better positioned, well aligned and currently ready entity type than federally chartered Credit Unions to provide individual identity and personal data services to Americans.
