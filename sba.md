## Project Introduction

Mission: To improve small business outcomes by transforming great analytics, information and web technology into usable business platforms so entreprenuers and other stakeholders can focus on business value not business plumbing.

Founded: The current research project commenced summer, 2016.

Number of Employees: This is a research project and has no employees at this time. 

Facility Description: This research project is being worked on in GitHub.

Product Sales: This research project is being developed as open source code.

## Opportunity

Need/Problem: This project aims to reduce the cost, complexity, delay and distraction of legal and procedural aspects necessary to startup and operate a business entity.  

Target Customer: Entreprenuers, investors and others who value formation and operation of efficient, rapid, effective and successfulnew businesses.

Value Proposition:  Reduced cost and delay in new business formation. 

Market Opportunity: The primary market for this solution is "day-forward" new business startups and secondarily may also include some existing businesses that seek to re-constitute themselves as automated entities.  According to the Kauffman Foundation Startup Activity Index, the rate of new entrepreneurs in the United States increased about 10 percent, from 280 out of 100,000 adults in the 2014 Startup Activity Index to 310 out of 100,000 adults in the 2015 Index. This increase translates into approximately 530,000 new business owners each month during the year.

## Technology Development

Technology/Research Overview: The team has developed a method to automated key business and legal dimensions of a business in a way that can enable the organization to exist as a data-driven, totally digital entity.  This approach is expected to enable positive revenue through a) enabling a platform for applied R&D and rapid product/service development, testing and deployment, b) reduction of direct cost and general distraction currently allocated to legal and administrative matters and c) access to "speed of thought" product-market fit and delivery through a growing network of companies that use the system and therefore "show up on directories, registries and other disoverable end-points as "automated entities" allowing high performance delivery to such companies when they are customers, efficient and innovative marketplace of partners and quick connections with prospective customers.

Intellectual Property Protection: The underlying code is open source, enabling top rate MIT anchored thinking to be quickly translatable for use in commerce, government and beyond.  A variety of business models are suitable for downstream private sector deployments of this project. 

Stage of Development: Basic research
